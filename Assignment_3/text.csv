"p","Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University) has completed 98 wonderful years since it’s foundation in 1921. A celebratory event was organized to mark the foundation of the college, which started with a lamp lightning ceremony. Chief guest Director, PEC, Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi, ex-Directors Vijay Gupta and Manoj Datta shared the podium with Dr. Divya Bansal. The Chief Guests also included Dr. Siby John (Deputy Director) and Dr. Sushant Samir (Registrar)."
"p","The lamp lighting ceremony was followed by the Director’s speech, where he started off by wishing Punjab Engineering College, a very happy 98th Birthday. He highlighted his vision for the University and re-emphasized his plans to promote internships and taking up transferred semesters in various institutions and universities to gain lots of exposure, something which is lacking in a lot of graduates of recent time. He also highlighted that Punjab Engineering College has the ‘top 1%’ of students, and inherently it becomes the responsibility of the University to provide them with apt care, attention and opportunities. His moto, change India by taking one step at a time, was highlighted to seek as much help, and as much experience as one possibly could, as it is only then that you learn."
"p","He then introduced Dr. Vijay Gupta, and elucidated that they both had a similar vision of what they wanted PEC to be. Dr. Gupta began on a light and yet an emotional note, stating that he was surprised he needed a microphone, as he had taken many a lecture in the same hall, behind the same podium, to an Auditorium full of students, without ever needing a mic. His golden rule, he stated, was that he believed in making many mistakes, but he’d rather err while experimenting than practicing. He too recognized the fact that providing a good student experience was paramount above all things. He then talked about how India still follows a science-based education system which is out of touch with our time and requirements. His speech was supplemented by Dr. Dutta. He opened his speech with a remarkable idea of ‘Free and Unrestricted Choice for Education’ and emphasized on continuous self-evaluation as a key to success. His main idea was that the University should take examples from other institutions, but never try to copy or clone them, the variance that a University provides over other institution is what attracts people. He also stated his idea about restructuring the M.Tech programs and provide more focus on them. His ideas to promote the entrepreneurship and start-ups in India were vivid and he highlighted the errs in using the ranking system for colleges and how they may be inaccurate and might lose their purpose."
"p","A dance performance by the Dramatics Club of PEC, and a video entailing the history of PEC and its highlights helped to raise the energy in the room."
"p","The event ended by Dr. Divya Bansal thanking all dignitaries and students present there for helping make this day truly memorable."

"p","The major concern is that when the institute opens for the next semester, several of PEC students would face economic hardships. Due to lockdown and consequent economic slowdown, we suspect that parents of many students would lose their jobs or have substantially reduced earnings. A couple of students have already approached us in this regard. We seek your contributions so that we can help such students. We encourage and gladly accept all gifts, no amount is too small."
"p","Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh is looking to establish several scholarships for its students through philanthropic contributions. Currently, an undergraduate student spends roughly Rs. 2.5 lakhs a year on tuition, lodging and boarding. It is desirable that a scholarship provides some reasonable financial support compared to the total expenditure of the student. Hence, it has been decided that the minimum amount of scholarship that can be established at PEC will be Rs. 50,000 per annum. Donors may wish to establish scholarships with larger amounts."
"p","Donation can be targeted towards the development and upkeep of a hostel or a similar facility. A hostel corridor or common facilities used by students can be adopted by a group/batch of alums and alums, as donors can ensure maintenance and upkeep of that room by contributing a decent amount."

"p","Description: The aim of the institution always remains to focus on the students’ overall development, whether it’s technical skills, cultural activities’ participation or academic skill set. With the same objective in mind, The Voyager Program introduces a new experience for the students of Punjab Engineering College (Deemed To Be University) giving them an opportunity for a holistic personality development."
"p","The program involves students visiting various Indian states during the summer break in groups of 3 (up to a maximum of 5 groups) allowing them to explore the country and the various communities and cultures that exist within. It involves students exploring the diverse corners of the country with minimal materialistic requirements, focussing on and diving into the beautifully diverse places, people and living conditions."
"p","Purpose: The objective of this program is to expose the students to the widely varying living conditions, cultures, values, traditions, beliefs, climate, and geographical conditions all over the country. It aims to engage students with different aspects of life by divulging them into raw social interaction giving them perspective into communities, people and difference in characteristics. It teaches them the importance of experience rather than materialistic things as they have to travel and stay in minimal living conditions in unfamiliar territories. It introduces them to circumstances where they have to enter into dialogue with people from different walks of life."
"p","The biggest take away from the program is gaining a perspective on life and the realisation of what things matter to them in life, their ambitions and an opportunity to break socially constructed aspirations. It is an attempt to instil qualities such as inquisitiveness, curiosity, retrospection, compassion and commitment in the fellows."
"p","The program is not a tourist experience; it’s a journey of exploring where the fellows will be discovering the country rather than enjoying a vacation. They will enter unknown territories and unknown adventures. The aim is for them to discover themselves during the process of discovering the country."
"p","Guidelines: The program is governed by the following general guidelines:"
"p","Report: The teams will have to submit a detailed report of their 30-40 day journey, featuring every location, duration, their learning, take away and experience. Formulation of the trip around a theme, describing anecdotes, friends etc. are some things that the recollection of the trip can contain."

Res. Express 4 015702. The Top Cited Paper Award is for corresponding authors from India, for work published across the entire IOP Publishing portfolio in the past three years (2017 to 2019), using citations recorded in Web of Science. The papers are in the top one per cent of the most-cited articles in each subject category along with the most-cited review article published in the last three years."
"p","In this article, Sanjeev Kumar and his co-authors reported the effect of Sr and Mn doping on the electrical and magnetic characteristics of BiFeO3 nanoparticles, synthesized by sol-gel technique. They observed that Sr doping in BiFeO3 showed substantial reduction in the leakage current whilst co-doping with Sr and Mn led to lower reduction in the leakage current through offering better performance over undoped BiFeO3, due to changes brought in the defect physics upon doping. Additionally, Sr and Mn co-doped BiFeO3 samples exhibit enhanced magnetization in comparison to undoped and Sr doped BiFeO3, possibly due to interruptions in the spin cycloid of BiFeO3."

The name of the Institute was later changed to Maclagan Engineering College and its started functioning under the name on March 19, 1924. In the year 1931, the college got affiliated to Punjab University, Lahore. After partition in 1947, the Institute was shifted to Roorkee (India) and was renamed as East Punjab College of Engineering. In the year 1950 the word East was dropped and it came to know by the name Punjab Engineering College. Towards the end of December 1953, the Institute shifted to its present campus in Chandigarh to function under Govt. of Punjab. In 1966, with the formation of Union Territory of Chandigarh, the institute came under control of Govt. of India through Chandigarh Administration. In October 2003, the Govt. of India notified the Punjab Engineering College as a Deemed to be University and thereafter it became known as Punjab Engineering College (Deemed University)."
